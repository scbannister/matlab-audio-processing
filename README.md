# MATLAB Audio Processing

This repo contains MATLAB code examples for creating alternative versions of music samples for listening and discussion in sensory evaluation focus groups in the Cadenza Project. Involves simple compression, bandpass filters, convolution of music audio with car noise room impulse responses, and LUFS normalisation (requires the custom function "LUFSNorm.m").
